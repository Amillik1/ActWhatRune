# ACT What Rune

This [Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT)](http://advancedcombattracker.com/) plugin informs you what rune to use for a given encounter!

## Setup
1. Download the plugin [ActWhatRune.dll](https://github.com/eq2reapp/ActWhatRune/blob/main/bin/Release/ActWhatRune.dll?raw=true) to a location on your hard drive
2. Open ACT and select the __Plugins__ tab
3. Click __Browse...__, and select the location where you saved the plugin
4. Click __Add/Enable Plugin__

## Configuration
See the [Help page](https://github.com/eq2reapp/ActWhatRune/wiki/Help).

## Building
This project was created using [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

The project user file is configured to launch ACT during debug -- this path may be different on your machine.

The entry point for the plugin is in __WhatRune.cs__.
